Executive Summary
Green Miles is a privacy-first blockchain-based platform that transforms sustainable commuting into verifiable climate action. The system converts green transportation choices (biking, walking, EVs, public transit, carpooling) into tradeable Green Miles Credits (GMC) while preserving user privacy through zero-knowledge proofs.
Vision: Turn every step, ride, or bus trip into verifiable climate action.
Mission: Create the world's most trusted and privacy-preserving mobility tracking system that incentivizes sustainable transportation choices.
